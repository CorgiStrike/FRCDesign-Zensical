# FRC Design Learning Course

Welcome to the design learning course, the main purpose and content of the website! Keep in mind that it's always a work in progress, so if you find any issues or have difficulty understanding something, please [give us feedback](https://forms.gle/dQ6w6RXJa6vSmcpw7 "Learning Course Feedback Form"){:target="_blank"}!

The purpose of the course is to take you from zero to being able to model a full robot. The content focuses on FRC-relevant features and tools, using engaging projects that not only introduce new CAD skills and practice old ones but also introduce engineering concepts. These projects gradually get less guided as you progress.

!!! Tip
    Despite how it looks, Onshape is quite different in its fundamentals from other CAD software. When starting the course, go to the relevant course setup page and continue through the course from there. **You will struggle with later stages** if you skip sections or exercises. If you consider yourself somewhat experienced, you will be able to do the early work very fast and probably still learn something; there's no reason to skip.

!!! Warning
    Before starting, remember to take a look at the [website feature guide](../website-feature-guide.md "Website Feature Guide Page"){:target="_blank"} to gain an understanding of the different features used throughout the learning course!

### [Course Setup](\learning-course\course-setup\new-to-cad "New to CAD Page")

- Three different starting points depending on your background
- The [New to CAD](\learning-course\course-setup\new-to-cad "New to CAD Page") page briefly introduces CAD software
- The [New to Onshape](\learning-course\course-setup\new-to-onshape\account-setup "New to CAD Page") section helps get you set up with Onshape
- The [Required Course Tools](\learning-course\course-setup\required-course-tools\part-library "New to CAD Page") section is required for everyone and helps you add the required tools for the course
